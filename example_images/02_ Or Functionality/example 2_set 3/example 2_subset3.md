## **Generated Images for Subset 3**

| **Image** 						   | **Resolved Prompt**  | **Description** 																						| **Comments** 																	 |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ![Image 1](example2_set3_image1.png) | `lake` 			  | A tranquil lake surrounded by lush greenery and distant mountains under a clear sky. 					| The resolved prompt emphasizes the lake with a serene, reflective composition. |
| ![Image 2](example2_set3_image2.png) | `lake` 			  | A wide, calm lake with faint ripples, bordered by forested slopes and distant peaks. 					| Captures a peaceful atmosphere with soft lighting and depth. 					 |
| ![Image 3](example2_set3_image3.png) | `lake` 			  | A lake framed by a tree in the foreground, with snow-capped mountains visible in the background. 		| Adds a dynamic composition with natural framing and contrasting elements. 	 |
| ![Image 4](example2_set3_image4.png) | `lake` 			  | A grassy field leading to a lake, with misty mountains in the background and a tree framing the view. 	| Combines a serene atmosphere with foreground interest and soft lighting. 		 |

## **Observations**

1. **Prompt Resolution**:
   - All images resolved to "lake," highlighting the grouped prompt's flexibility in selecting varied lake-based scenes.

2. **Compositional Variations**:
   - Each image offers unique perspectives, from wide-angle views to natural framing with trees and grassy fields.

3. **Atmospheric Effects**:
   - The subset captures serene and peaceful atmospheres, with diverse lighting and environmental details.

4. **Focus on Lakes**:
   - The lake remains the central feature, but the inclusion of foreground elements like trees and grassy fields adds depth and character.
